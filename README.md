# Circ-renderer

It's a simple tool to render a Logisim Circ file and simulate some of its components

> **Note:** This project is still in development, so it may not work as expected.

## Installation

You can use any of your preferred node package manager to install this package.

```bash
npm install circ-renderer
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { CircRenderer } from 'circ-renderer';

// ...

const file = await fetch('./file.circ');
const fileContent = await file.text();

const options = // optional

const canvasElement = new CircRenderer(fileContent, options);

document.body.appendChild(canvasElement);
```

## Options

<!-- table of options with key, required, default, description -->

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `width` | No | 800 | The width of the canvas |
| `height` | No | 600 | The height of the canvas |
| `scale` | No | 1 | The scale of the canvas |
| `theme` | No | - | Color Scheme and skin instructions |

## Theming and Skins

Theming and skins are still in very early development, the idea is to provide a way to customize the look of the components and the canvas.
platform independent, so you can have multple themes and skins for the same circuit.

### Theme Object

```typescript
const theme: CircTheme = {
  colors: // color scheme
  library: // skin instructions
}
```

### Color Scheme

The color scheme is a simple object that contains the colors for the components and the canvas.

```typescript
// Default color scheme
const colors = {
 primary: "#007bff",
 primary1: "#007bff",
 primary2: "#0056b3",
 backgroundPrimary: "#f8f9fa",
 backgroundPrimaryAlt: "#f8f9fa",
 backgroundSecondary: "#f8f9fa",
 red: "#dc3545",
 orange: "#fd7e14",
 yellow: "#ffc107",
 green: "#28a745",
 cyan: "#17a2b8",
 blue: "#007bff",
 purple: "#6f42c1",
 pink: "#e83e8c", // <- used as base color all default skins
 // These base?? means nothing. possibly will be removed in the future
 base00: "#ffffff",
 base05: "#f8f9fa",
 base10: "#f1f3f5",
 base20: "#e9ecef",
 base25: "#dee2e6",
 base30: "#ced4da",
 base35: "#adb5bd",
 base40: "#868e96",
 base50: "#495057",
 base60: "#343a40",
 base70: "#212529",
 base100: "#000000",
};
```

### Skin Instructions

The skin instructions are simple functions that recives a set of parameters and renders the draw instructions of the component in the canvas.

> This is still in development, so the API may change in the future. i'm experimenting with different ways to implement.

> **Note:** The Skin does not render the component ports, this is done by the renderer.

```typescript
import {
  type NotState, // params from the file.
  type DrawArguments, // arguments used for rendering in canvas, theme information, assets, and component location information.
} from "circ-renderer";

// Example of a skin instruction
const NotSkin = ({
  dimensions,
  ctx,
  theme,
  assets,
}: DrawArguments<NotState>) => {
  const [width, height] = dimensions;

  ctx.drawImage(assets.NOT, 0, -height / 2, width, height * 2);

  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.font = `${6}px monospace`;

  ctx.fillStyle = theme.colors.base00;
  ctx.strokeStyle = theme.colors.base70;
  ctx.lineWidth = 0.5;
  ctx.textAlign = "center";
  ctx.fill();

  ctx.save();
  ctx.translate(width / 2, height);
  ctx.rotate(-Math.PI / 2);

  ctx.strokeText("NOT", 5, -5);

  ctx.fillText("NOT", 5, -5);
  ctx.restore();
};
```

### Assets

The assets is an experiment to provide a way to render the components with images, this is not the best way to do, but it's a way to do it and I WILL CHANGE IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

```typescript
export const prepareTheme = async (): Promise<CircTheme> => {
  const assets = await loadAsset();

  return {
    colors,
    library: {
      LED: (drawArgs) => LEDSkin({ ...drawArgs, assets }),
      NOT: (drawArgs) => NotSkin({ ...drawArgs, assets }),
      pin: (drawArgs) => PinSkin({ ...drawArgs, assets }),
      wire: (drawArgs) => WireSkin({ ...drawArgs, assets }),
      AND: (drawArgs) => AndSkin({ ...drawArgs, assets }),
      NAND: (drawArgs) => NandSkin({ ...drawArgs, assets }),
      OR: (drawArgs) => OrSkin({ ...drawArgs, assets }),
      XOR: (drawArgs) => XorSkin({ ...drawArgs, assets }),
    },
  };
};
```

load the assets in the way you like and then overload the skin functions from your theme to use the assets.

my plan is to provide a nice API to render the components with much of hassle and boilerplate. but for now, this is the way to do it.
